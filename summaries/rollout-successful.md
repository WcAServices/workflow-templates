  <summary>About enabling Slack notifications</summary>

    > Slack notifications are a little tricky for organizations without shared secrets. For now, sending the following message
    in Slack should do the trick for getting deployment notifications. ðŸ‘Œ

  ```shell
   # Run in whichever Slack channel you need notifications in.

   /github subscribe $GITHUB_REPOSITORY deployments
  ```
